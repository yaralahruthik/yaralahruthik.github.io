        <h1>What am I?</h1>
        <h3>I am a homo sapiens trying to evolve. Well, </h3>
        <p>A wannabe zoologist pursuing computer science, having photography as a passion and had cats, dogs and hamsters as pets. Also got a gaming laptop and lost interest in it, I mean I play every now and then but cannot waste my time straight forward for 6-8 hours. I play soccer and learnt a lot of martial arts to not get bullied. I read fiction, a huge fan of Amish’s Shiva Trilogy, and I was kind of late into all this reading books that I have only read about 100 books till date. I hate music it distracts me, so I listen to it only when I am highly distracted. I love watching The Big Bang Theory, Lucifer, Dr House MD and any documentaries regarding our Earth. By the way, Global Warming is real, and its effects are already felt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love animals and I eat them too; I do not see why some people are troubled by that fact (I mean I am a carnivore, but I am not hungry all the time). I am fascinated by cat’s curiosity and dog’s honesty (even cats are honest in their own way). Trees and plants make me feel so surreal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I like spending money, but I spend it only for quality as you know I am concerned about Global Warming (also I do not like it when someone owns the same thing I own). Vanity is one of my favourite words. These books have broadened my mind; The Power of Habit, The Influential Mind and What Every Body is Saying.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I do not like to remember things and somehow, I am good at Mathematics. I like to be organised and follow rules if they are logically placed. I prefer my shoes clean (you see a person’s shoe can tell you a lot about them).</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think this is enough for now, I might refine this later when I start writing on The Medium.</p>
